Chisel Coverage Property Project:

Done:
{
    - build chisel 2
    - figure out chisel 2 sbt build system
}

Todo:
{
    - setup project on millennium
        - build chisel 2 test harness
        {
            - Done:
            {
                - create Adder src files
            }
            - Todo:
            {
                - figure out how to generate C++
                - figure out how to generate Verilog
            }
        }
    - setup intellij on millennium
    - create chisel 2 general program flow
    - plan out DSP for coverage properties
}

Notes:
{
    - probably want to generate real chisel nodes annotated as coverage in chisel 3
}
